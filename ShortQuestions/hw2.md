### What is *wrapper class* in Java and Why we need _wrapper class_?
Wrapper classes provide a way to use primitive data types (int, boolean, etc..) as objects.

Sometimes you must use wrapper classes, for example when working with Collection objects, such as ArrayList, 
where primitive types cannot be used (the list can only store objects):
 
 `ArrayList<int> myNumbers = new ArrayList<int>(); // Invalid`
 
`ArrayList<Integer> myNumbers = new ArrayList<Integer>(); // Valid`

Another useful method is the toString() method, which is used to convert wrapper objects to strings.

### What is the difference between *HashMap* and _HashTable_?
1. HashMap is non-synchronized. It is not thread-safe and can't be shared between many threads without proper synchronization code.
2. HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values.
3. Hashtable is synchronized. It is thread-safe and can be shared with many threads.
4. Hashtable doesn't allow any null key or value.
5. HashMap is generally preferred over Hashtable if thread synchronization is not needed.

### What is String pool in Java and why we need String pool?
String pool is a special storage in java Heap memory where string literals are stored. It is used to store String values, 
when a String literal is created, JVM first checks the String Pool before creating a new String object corresponding to it.

### What is Java garbage collection?
Java applications obtain objects in memory as needed. It is the task of garbage collection (GC) in the Java virtual machine (JVM) 
to automatically determine what memory is no longer being used by a Java application and to recycle this memory for other uses.

Garbage collection frees the programmer from manually dealing with memory deallocation. 
As a result, certain categories of application program bugs are eliminated or substantially reduced by GC:

- Dangling pointer bugs, which occur when a piece of memory is freed while there are still pointers to it, and one of those pointers is dereferenced. By then the memory may have been reassigned to another use with unpredictable results.
- Double free bugs, which occur when the program tries to free a region of memory that has already been freed and perhaps already been allocated again.
- Certain kinds of memory leaks, in which a program fails to free memory occupied by objects that have become unreachable, which can lead to memory exhaustion.

### What are access modifiers and their scopes in Java?
Access modifierï¼š keywords that can be used to control the visibility of fields, methods, and contractors in java class.

1. private: only can see from the same class.
2. Default:  can see from the same class, same package and same package non-subclass.
3. protected: can see from the same class, same package, same package non-subclass and different package subclass.
4. public: can see from the same class, same package, same package non-subclass, different package subclass and different class non-subclass.### What is final key word? (Filed, Method, Class)
